# Mount Dora lidar: roofs, bare earth, trees and roofs over the water

Roof form, eave and ridge heights and ground elevation for each of the 950
game buildings, and a 1 m bare-earth grid of the whole map, measured from USGS
3DEP lidar (public domain). County records ([house-reference.json](../house-reference.json))
give storeys and materials but never the roof shape; this fills that gap and
puts a measured height on every building.

It also finds the tree crowns and the roofs over the lake. The generator plants
a tree in each crown its seeded greenery leaves empty
([crowns.json](crowns.json)), and the art kit draws each roof over the water as
an open roof on posts ([water-roofs.json](water-roofs.json)). Nothing else here
changes the generator, the sectors, `features.json` or the art kit. The Pages
build does not publish `maps/mount-dora/reference/`.

## Source

The National Map lists two lidar collections over the town box:

| Collection | Tiles | Size | Used |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| FL_LAKECO_2007 | 4 | 210 MB | No: eleven years older, legacy delivery |
| FL_Peninsular_2018_D18 (Lake County block, FL_Peninsular_Lake_2018) | 4 | 1.38 GB | Yes |

The 2018 collection was flown on **6 December 2018** (6 flight lines, one day,
from the points' GPS times) with a Riegl VQ-1560 and a Leica ALS80. The
original CRS is NAD83(2011) / Florida East (US feet) with NAVD88 heights
(GEOID12B). Over the game extent it holds:

| Returns per m² | |
| --- | ---: |
| All returns | 29.6 |
| Usable (not withheld, not noise) | 26.5 |
| First returns | 22.3 |
| Ground (class 2) | 8.5 |
| Building (class 6) | 2.4 |

rockyweb.usgs.gov serves the four tiles but answers every download with HTTP
429, so [fetch-lidar.mjs](../../../../tools/maps/lidar/fetch-lidar.mjs) reads
the same points from their Entwine copy on AWS Open Data
(`s3://usgs-lidar-public/FL_Peninsular_Lake_2018`). It takes only the octree
nodes that meet the game extent plus 60 m, at full density: 1,724 nodes,
90,878,212 points, 448 MB, cached in the gitignored `artifacts/lidar/`.
[source.json](source.json) records the coverage query, the four original tiles
and every node's size and SHA-256.

**Decoding without a dependency.** Entwine stores the nodes as LAZ (LAS 1.2,
point format 1, LASzip pointwise v2). [laz.mjs](../../../../tools/maps/lidar/laz.mjs)
decodes them in plain JavaScript. It was checked once against laz-perf 0.0.7,
Hobu's WebAssembly build of LASzip, installed outside the repository: all
1,724 nodes, all 90,878,212 points, identical in every field read here
(coordinates, returns, class byte, flight line, GPS time, class flags).
Every node is also checked against its own header and octree cube. One quirk
was found: Entwine writes LAS 1.4's 4-bit return numbers into the 3-bit fields
(8 becomes 0, 9 becomes 1) while its header counts the originals. That affects
only late noise returns.

## Registration

Points go EPSG:3857 → WGS84 latitude/longitude → town metres through
[projection.mjs](../../../../tools/maps/house-reference/projection.mjs), the
port of the generator's own projection. The outlines are each building's
`geographicGeometry`.

The lidar's building returns sit **0.84 m south and 0.04 m west** of the OSM
outlines. Shifting the outlines that way raises the share of outline cells
over class-6 returns from 0.909 to 0.925. The 30 sectors with ten or more
buildings agree with that shift to within 0.22 m (median) and 0.71 m (worst).
All sampling below uses the shifted outlines.

## Per building

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `groundM` | NAVD88 metres: median of the ground returns within 4 m outside the outline (all 950 had enough) |
| `groundRangeM` | 10th–90th percentile of that ring; 235 buildings have 1 m or more (sloping lots) |
| `heightM` | Percentiles of all roof returns above `groundM` |
| `eaveM` | Where the roof over most of the outline meets the walls: the area-weighted median of the roof planes' low edges. For a flat roof, its deck |
| `ridgeM` | 98th percentile of roof heights |
| `upperEaveM`, `upperShare` | Set when a taller roof stands 1.5 m or more above `eaveM` (37 buildings): its eave, and its share of the plane area |
| `storeysFromLidar` | One storey below a 4.6 m eave, then one more every 3.2 m |
| `roof.form` | `flat`, `gable`, `hip`, `other` or `unknown` (see below), with `confidence` 0–1 |
| `roof.ridgeBearingDeg` | Gable and hip only: 0–180°, clockwise from north |
| `roof.pitchDeg`, `roof.pitch12` | Median slope of the pitched planes, in degrees and as rise per 12 run |
| `planes` | Up to six largest planes: area m², slope °, downslope bearing °, fit rms m, low edge m, top m |
| `coverage` | Share of the outline with roof returns |

Roof returns are the vendor's class 6 (building) inside the outline. Where
class 6 covers under 30% of an outline (13 buildings: sheds and carports), the
unclassified last returns 1.5 m or more above the ground are added.

## Roof form

Returns are binned to 0.5 m cells, each cell keeping a robust centroid. A
least-squares plane is fitted to each cell's 5×5 neighbourhood. Planar cells,
best first, grow into roof planes. The rules, fixed before the town was run:

- **flat**: at least 75% of the plane area slopes under 10°.
- **gable**: pitched, and the roof runs parallel to part of the outline along
  at least 12% of the sampled edge length. A gable end shows as such a rake.
- **hip**: pitched, with eaves on every side.
- **other**: mixed flat and pitched roof, a roof that rises to an edge (shed or
  complex), or one less than half explained by planes.
- **unknown**: under 4 m² of roof returns, or under a quarter of the outline covered.

| Form | Buildings | Confidence ≥ 0.7 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| gable | 569 | 529 |
| other | 155 | 99 |
| hip | 118 | 88 |
| flat | 104 | 101 |
| unknown | 4 | — |

Ridge bearings were checked against the walls: 98.9% of gable ridges and 98.3%
of hip ridges lie within 5° of an outline wall direction (median 1°). Random
bearings fall within 10° only 26.5% and 20.3% of the time. Median pitch is 22°
(quartiles 18° and 26°, about 4.9:12). The county's roof cover agrees with the
forms: 13 of 18 tar-and-gravel roofs read flat, and only 11 of 698 shingle,
metal or tile roofs do.

## Validation

**County storeys.** The gate was fixed before the first run. It needs at least
80% of the outlines of 20 m² or more to be half covered, a ROC AUC of at least
0.8 for the eave height separating county two-storey from one-storey buildings,
and Cohen's κ of at least 0.4 between county and lidar storeys (1 / 2 / 3+).
The negative controls repeat the whole pipeline with every outline shifted
30 m east, then 30 m north. They must fail.

| Run | Covered | AUC | κ | Gate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Outlines as registered | 0.989 | 0.883 | 0.541 | pass |
| Control: 30 m east | 0.622 | 0.577 | 0.064 | fail |
| Control: 30 m north | 0.631 | 0.566 | 0.029 | fail |
| Pre-registered wall measure (5th-percentile height) | 0.989 | 0.733 | 0.283 | fail |

The pre-registered measure failed. Porch, carport and wing roofs inside an
outline set its low percentile, so two-storey houses read as one (73 of 106).
It was replaced by the plane-based eave; the thresholds and the gate did not
change. A third variant, the eave of the tallest roof, was also tried: AUC
0.894, κ 0.491. It latched onto small upper roofs and is kept only as
`upperEaveM`. The table above is therefore not a blind test. The controls are
what show the agreement comes from the right buildings.

| County storeys | Buildings | Eave, quartiles (m) |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 796 | 2.73 / 3.06 / 3.56 |
| 2 | 106 | 5.01 / 5.80 / 6.46 |
| 3+ | 5 | 10.17 / 10.89 / 11.29 |

Lidar agrees with the county on 87.8% of buildings. Most disagreements are
measured correctly but sit on a boundary of the storey rule:

- tall one-storey churches, halls, warehouses and stores (decks or eaves at
  4.8–5.6 m) read as two storeys;
- 1½-storey bungalows with dormers fall between the classes;
- the county record was joined by ground-floor area (`parcel-area`), the
  weakest join.

**Built after the flight.** The county dates 10 game buildings 2019 or later.
6 of them have under half their outline covered, and those 6 make up 6 of the
10 under-half-covered buildings. Three of the four `unknown` buildings are 2020–2021 builds.

**Landmarks.**

| Building | County | Lidar | Eave / ridge (m) | Form |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Lakeside Inn: Gables | 2 | 2 | 6.47 / 11.26 | hip (low confidence) |
| Lakeside Inn: Terrace | 2 | 2 | 7.55 / 11.65 | gable (low confidence) |
| Lakeside Inn: Gatehouse | 2 | 2 | 7.56 / 9.95 | gable |
| Lakeside Inn: Sunset | 3 | 3 | 8.15 / 12.06 | gable |
| Lakeside Inn: Grand Lobby | 2 | 3 | 8.03 / 11.21 | gable |
| Lakeside Inn: Fisherman's Tavern | 2 | 3 | 7.95 / 12.83 | other |
| Lakeside Inn: Alexander | 1 | 2 | 7.24 / 9.64 | gable |
| Lakeside Inn: Beauclaire | 2 | 1 | 3.68 / 4.00 | flat |
| Lakeside Inn: "Lakeside Inn" outline | 1 | 1 | 1.56 / 1.86 | flat |
| Donnelly House | 2 | 1 | 3.96 / 12.08; upper eave 7.88 (43%) | other |

The inn's two-storey wings that the county joined by outline (Gables, Terrace,
Gatehouse, Sunset) all agree. The four disagreements are all `parcel-area`
joins. The Grand Lobby and Fisherman's Tavern have 8 m eaves: two tall hotel
storeys, read as three. The Donnelly House's wraparound porch roof sets its
eave at 3.96 m. Its main roof, two planes at 50° (14.5:12), starts at 7.88 m:
two tall Victorian storeys, which `upperEaveM` carries.

**Grantham Point lighthouse.** 296 returns within 3 m of the named point form
a 3 m tapered tower. Its top is **7.03 m (23.1 ft)** above the surrounding
ground (19.55 m) and 7.8 m above the lake. The published figure is 35 ft
(10.67 m), and the art kit's proxy is 10.6 m. With 22 first returns per m²
the lidar cannot miss 3.6 m of a solid tower, so the published height (or
what it measures) is the doubtful number. The proxy is about 3.6 m too tall.

## Bare earth

[bare-earth.png](bare-earth.png) is the game's 1 m grid: 1,440 × 1,680 cells,
origin town (0, 0), x east, y south. Row 0 is the northern edge; cell (i, j)
covers x ∈ [i, i+1), y ∈ [j, j+1). Each 16-bit sample is the elevation in
centimetres above NAVD88. [bare-earth-source.png](bare-earth-source.png) says
how each cell was made:

| Value | Cells | Meaning |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 65.9% | Mean of the ground returns in the cell |
| 1 | 15.5% | Filled: push-pull interpolation under buildings, trees and gaps |
| 2 | 18.6% | Lake Dora, at the lidar water level 18.82 m (61.75 ft) |

The ground runs from 18.53 m at the shore to 54.72 m on the downtown ridge, a
36 m relief the game does not have yet. [bare-earth.json](bare-earth.json)
holds the grid definition and the SHA-256 of both sample arrays. A PNG's bytes
depend on the zlib build, so checks compare the decoded samples.

## Tree crowns

[crowns.json](crowns.json) holds 6,968 crowns over the game extent, 86.7 ha
of canopy. Their heights run 5.92 / 13.17 / 19.39 m (10th, 50th and 90th
percentiles) and their widths 2.93 / 7.94 / 18.07 m. `tools/maps/lidar/crowns.mjs`
finds them:

- This vendor classes no vegetation, so trees are among the unclassified
  returns. The canopy is the highest one over the bare earth in each 0.5 m
  cell, where it stands 2.5 m or more up and the cell holds no building return.
- Each canopy cell climbs a 3 × 3 mean of the canopy to the top it reaches.
- Neighbouring tops are one crown unless the lower stands 2 m above the saddle
  between them. Crowns merge highest saddle first, so one bumpy crown is one
  tree, and never into a crown over 400 m², which is about the town's big live
  oaks. A closed woodland canopy is many trees.
- A crown under 4 m² is dropped. So is one under 1.5 m across, four standard
  deviations along its minor axis, which is overhead wire.
- So is one where under 10% of its canopy returns came from pulses that
  returned more than once. Foliage lets a pulse through to return again lower
  down, while a wire, a pole, a sign or a roof the vendor left unclassified
  stops it. This drops 188 crowns, listed in `notFoliage`. Among them are
  the wire along East 9th Avenue, a roof on a dock at x 61–67, y 631–642, and
  parts of Dora Villa Condominiums' flat roof. Of the six dropped crowns 15 m
  or taller, five are centred inside its outline and the sixth 0.8 m outside
  it. Kept crowns have a 10th percentile of 0.239 and a median of 0.427.
- A crown is also taken out when three things hold. It is centred inside an
  outline the game draws. Its top stops the scanner: under 10% of the canopy
  returns within 2 m of the top. And the crown as a whole reads under 15%.
  Such a crown is that building's roof. A tree overhanging a roof lets the
  scanner through across its crown. One crown is taken out this way, listed in
  `roofTops`: the rest of Dora Villa's roof, 197 m² and 25 m up, whose edge
  foliage lifted it to 0.11. The aerial view shows the flat roof, with trees
  only along its west side.

The thresholds come from the method; they were not tuned to the town. The one
exception is the roof rule's 15%, set after review found Dora Villa's roof.
Rows are `[topX, topY, centreX, centreY, areaM2, heightM, widthM, multiShare,
topShare]` in town metres: the lidar position minus the outline registration,
which comes from features.json's OSM outlines. `topShare` is null where no
canopy return stands within 2 m of the top (9 of the kept crowns). The file pins both its
lidar source and features.json.

`build-mount-dora.py` moves each crown with the town by the field at its top,
as it moves the inside of a park. It plants one tree in a crown with no trunk
within its radius of its centre: 3,802 trees. Of the other crowns,
2,508 already hold a trunk and 658 have no clear green ground within
reach. The trunk goes on the clear green ground nearest the top, within half
the crown's radius (at least 1 m) and 2 m from other trunks. It never stands on
brush already painted (the town refuses brush under a plant) or on a mapped
sports pitch. A tree outside every mapped habitat (a lawn, a verge) records its
habitat as `unmapped`. The tree is mature from 12 m tall. It is a pine where the
crown stands at least twice as tall as it is wide; the game has no palm.
Planting comes after the sentries and validator markers, 1.45 m from every
post and patrol route and a cell from every marker, so neither moves. The
seeded plants are unchanged. `project.json` pins the file
(`generation.vegetation.lidarCrowns`).

## Roofs over the water

[water-roofs.json](water-roofs.json) holds 13 roofs on Lake Dora that no
OpenStreetMap or county outline draws: boathouses, covered slips, the marina's
four slip rows and the hip roof at the T-dock's shore end. Between them they
have 24 pieces and 3,155 m². `tools/maps/lidar/water-roofs.mjs` finds them:

- **Roofs.** Building returns, in the town frame, bin into 0.5 m cells. Two
  cells join into one roof, over land and water alike, where some return of
  one lies within 0.74 m of some return of the other.
  - Cells up to two apart are compared, so a roof is its returns' own cluster
    at that distance, wherever the grid falls. That holds from a cell's
    diagonal up (0.707 m): two returns in one cell always join. The code
    refuses a shorter join.
  - Cells alone would join two roofs under a metre apart at some grid offsets
    and not at others: a 3 cm shift of the grid joined the marina to the drawn
    boathouse north of it, and the whole marina went as that building's own.
- **The join distance is set from this town.** It sits midway in the window,
  0.68–0.81 m (measured in 0.01 m steps), where the town's water roofs do not
  change:
  - below 0.674 m, the corner of a drawn house at x 73, y 459 splits off as a
    14th roof;
  - from 0.811 m, the small roof at x 522, y 1006 joins the marina;
  - from about 0.86 m, the marina joins the drawn boathouse and goes.

  Each roof kept holds together by links of 0.54 m or less. The made-up tests
  hold two roofs 0.85 m apart as two, and one roof with a 0.72 m gap as one, at
  ten grid offsets each.
- **Where the grid and the registration fall.**
  `tools/maps/lidar/sweep-water-roofs.mjs`, a review tool outside the build,
  rebuilds the town:
  - at 100 grid phases (0.05 m steps in x and y);
  - at 24 registration offsets out to 0.2 m each way;
  - at 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 m north.

  The sectors' registration disagrees by 0.22 m at the median and 0.71 m at
  worst (above). Every run kept the same 13 roofs, with 23–27 pieces and
  2,925–3,158 m². These runs are samples, not proof, and only two pieces were
  followed by name:
  - The marina's walkway (below) is left out when the registration moves
    0.2 m or more north. Here that holds at 0.2 m north with x −0.2, −0.1
    or 0, and due north at 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 m. Round 8's review found it due
    north at every distance tried up to 1.0 m, and with x ±0.2 at 0.5 and
    0.7 m north. It stays at a few offsets that also move it east or shift the
    grid: 0.2 m north with x +0.1 or +0.2, and 0.3 m north with x +0.2 or at
    grid phase (0.4, 0.15).
  - The east-shore fragment is kept with the walkway's group at two grid
    phases.
  - The fragment is also kept between the sampled phases, at about x
    0.33–0.34, y 0.43, where the walkway's rectangle reaches it.
- **Near a bar.** Each decision rests on shares counted in grid cells, and a
  share sitting on its bar can fall either way. For every piece and record,
  water-roofs.json's `nearBar` lists the measures within 0.05 of their bar
  that decide it: moved across the bar alone, they would keep the piece, leave
  it out, or change why. On the town:
  - the marina's 206.6 m² walkway, kept by its outline share of 0.53;
  - roofs 2 and 7, kept by the water in their rings, 0.788 and 0.787 against
    0.75;
  - the east-shore fragment (its ring's water 0.78), which goes with its group
    either way.
- **Which roofs are kept.** A roof is kept when:
  - at least 1 m² of it lies in Lake Dora's OSM outline;
  - at most 25% of it lies inside an outline the game draws (OSM and county
    buildings, the generator's structures).

  A roof joined to a drawn one beyond that share belongs to that building: a
  wing, a porch, or an attached boathouse its county sketch leaves out.
- **Left to the outlines.** Cells within 1 m of a drawn outline are left to it:
  429 m² of the marina's walkway, which a county sketch covers.
- **Parts and pieces.** The rest of a roof splits into parts. Each part is the
  smallest rectangle around it, unless that would roof over open water of a
  piece's size: a 6 m² rectangle, 1.5 m wide, that its cells do not fill.
  Otherwise the part becomes the largest rectangles its cells fill, one after
  another, in the frame where the largest is biggest. That frame is the main
  body's, not one a stray corner turned. A turned roof's staircase on the grid
  is not open water.
- **Over water.** A piece stands over water where half of it lies in the
  lake's outline, or where the lidar sees water around it. To see water, half
  the cells within 3 m of the piece must read as water or ground, and 75% of
  those must read as water. The cells under the piece's own roof (the rest of
  its structure) are no part of its ring: they hide nothing it stands over.
  They include the structure's cells left to a drawn outline: 109 of the 254
  the walkway's ring leaves out. Counted as unread instead, no decision changed
  in round 8's 154 rebuilds. Each roof records its pieces left out over land
  (`onLand`) apart from those whose ring is too little read (`unread`). A
  cell reads as water when it holds water returns,
  or no return at all, because calm water returned none. A dock or reeds in
  the water read as water too. That is a cell within 3 m of such water, with
  no ground return (classes 2 and 20), and with most of its returns between
  half a metre under the lake's level and 1.5 m over it. Lake Dora's OSM
  outline runs 5–10 m off the lidar's water along parts of the shore.
- **Left out.** The pieces over neither are left out. A piece is 'not over
  water' where what the lidar reads of its ring is under 75% water. It is 'too
  little read around it' where what it reads is water but under half the ring
  is read, or nothing at all is read; that is no evidence of land.
  - The pieces kept form groups, joined where their returns lie within 0.74 m
    of one another, as cells join.
  - A group under half in the lake's outline, by area, that touches a piece
    left out as not over water is part of what stands on land. It is left out
    with that piece ('joined only to pieces left out').
  - A slip split into a body and a stub is so judged whole, even where the stub
    reaches into the outline.

  These 11 pieces, 383 m², are listed in `leftOut` with their measures and
  reason: the marina's east-shore shed, its north-west tower, and scraps north
  of its walkway. One of them is the shed's 9.5 m² north end, which reads as
  over water but lies wholly outside the outline. It is kept with the walkway
  at the few phases above. A piece left out with its group records the group's
  share in the outline, and how many pieces over land it touched. A group that
  touches such a piece and stays records its share on each of its pieces too.
  Parts under 6 m², a part's cells no piece covers, and roofs left with none
  go without a record. Roofs the vendor left unclassified are not among the
  building returns at all; the roofs over the water in the followups are such.
- **Outline and heights.** Each piece's outline is the rectangle, in its
  frame, around its own returns. Its eave, ridge, form, pitch and ridge
  bearing come from those returns, by the roof rules above, in metres above
  the lake's lidar level (18.82 m).

The art kit draws each roof as a `boathouse` placement
([production.md](../../../../docs/art/mount-dora/production.md)).

## Running it

From the repository root, with Node 22 or later and no dependencies:

```powershell
node tools/maps/lidar/fetch-lidar.mjs          # 448 MB of Entwine nodes into artifacts/lidar/, a few minutes
node --max-old-space-size=12288 tools/maps/lidar/build-lidar.mjs   # about 1-2 minutes
node tools/maps/lidar/build-lidar.mjs --check  # needs the cache; re-derives everything
node --test tests/maps/lidar.test.mjs tests/maps/lidar-crowns-roofs.test.mjs  # no cache needed
```

`lidar-crowns-roofs.test.mjs` checks the crown and water-roof rules on made-up
canopies and a made-up shore, and both files against their inputs and rules.

The test decodes one committed node
(`tests/maps/fixtures/lidar-ept-11-1070-1042-1017.laz`, 63 KB). It checks the
roof rules on synthetic roofs and the committed outputs against their inputs,
and it recomputes the gate. Mutation testing killed all 14 mutants of the
decoder, roof rules, raster helpers and statistics.

## Caveats

- The lidar shows December 2018. Buildings built or demolished since then do
  not match it; `coverage` flags them.
- Class 6 is the vendor's automatic building class. A roof under a tree keeps
  the part the vendor classified.
- `storeysFromLidar` is a coarse rule. Tall one-storey commercial buildings
  read high. Prefer the county's storeys where a record exists.
- OSM outlines merge porches with houses. `eaveM` is the eave over most of the
  outline; `planes` and `upperEaveM` show the parts.
- A tree leaning over a roof loses the cells that hold building returns. A
  dense crown that stopped nine pulses in ten would be read as no tree.
- A roof over the water shows its top only: its walls, cover and posts are
  unknown, and the art kit draws them open, metal and inferred. A roof whose
  ridge the planes do not explain (`other`) is drawn flat.

## Proposed use in the generator (not applied)

- Base each building at `groundM` on the bare-earth grid, and give Mount Dora
  its terrain.
- Take wall height from `eaveM`, and roof shape from `roof.form`,
  `ridgeBearingDeg` and `pitchDeg` where the form is flat, gable or hip with
  `confidence` ≥ 0.7. That covers 718 of 950 buildings.
- Take storeys in this order: survey, then county, then `storeysFromLidar`.

As with the county reference, adopting this regenerates the owned outputs, so
the map's owner should make that change. AGENTS.md applies to it: verify the
result through the real game path (import and editor playtest), and keep each
value's source, observation date (6 December 2018) and uncertainty
(`confidence`, `coverage`) alongside it.
